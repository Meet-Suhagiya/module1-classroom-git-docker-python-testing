## Module Description

In this module, you will be introduced to GitHub Classroom as well as the tools used to
automate software development tasks. GitHub Classroom is a tool provided to teachers that helps leverage the processes
and tools used to automate tasks required during the software development process such as testing and deployment. This
process is often referred to as continuous integration and continuous deployment(CI/CD). The processes and tools you
will be introduced to in this unit are the fundamental tools used by DevOps engineers to get code from the developer to 
wherever it needs to be deployed for users to use.

## Lessons

1.  

## Follow the following steps to get started:

Each module in this course will follow the same process, unless otherwise noted on the assignment.

1. Add your information to this file: [here](myinfo.json)  - Replace change with your information.
2. Click the "Start Assignment" button below to accept this assignment. The assignment will be duplicated on the NJIT
   WIS GitHub organization, and then you will be added to the repository along with the professor and the graders.
3. Clone the repository to your local computer using Pycharm.
4. Type "python -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt" to install the dependencies
5. When you complete the assignment, you must push the code back and then go to the "Actions" tab on your repositories'
   homepage to see it autograde the assignment. If the autograder turns green then you got 100, if it is red then you
   will need to click on the autograder link on that page to find your errors to fix them. You should test if your code
   passes
   the grader locally before pushing by following the tip below.

## Tips

1. If you type "python -m pytest -c pytest_grade.ini" the code will run the grader tests.
2. If you type "python -m pytest" the code will run your own automated tests that you put in the "tests" folder.
3. If you type "python -m pytest -s" you will be able to see your print statements your code output when you run the
   tests
4. If you type "python -m pytest <replace with the path to the test file>" you can run a specific test file
5. Whenever you see <replace with...> don't replace the entire string including the < > signs.
