## Program Description
This code is a simple Python script that implements a program that outputs "Hello, [name]" to the console. The name to be output is specified as a command line argument. If there is no command line argument, it outputs "Hello, ". The code has three functions: main(), get_argument_as_string(), and console_out(). The main() function is the entry point of the program, and the other two functions are helper functions to get the command line argument and print to the console, respectively.
